Chengjiguanli - A simple student score management program.

Author: wks

This program assumes a scenario where:

* There are zero or more students.
* Each student enrolls in zero or more courses.
* For each student and a course the student enrolled, a score is recorded.

This program can create, read, update and delete students and their scores.
This program can also compute the total scores a student has obtained.

This program is released under GNU GPL v2.

This program is inspired by the idea of a friend of mine.  Any resemblence
to any assignments of computer science courses are coincident.  If it resem-
bles your assignment, DO NOT SIMPLY COPY THIS PROGRAM because YOU SHOULD DO
YOUR OWN HOMEWORK!
